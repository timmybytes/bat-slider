# The Bat-Slider

![The Bat-Slider Screenshot]()

This is a simple React app to display information on the various Bat-Suits seen in film over the years.

Bat-Slider is a React app that uses [`rc-slider`](https://github.com/react-component/slider) and React Hooks to dynamically render content based on the many Batman suits seen in film since 1943.

The goal of the project was to get more comfortable with changing state, using JSON objects, CSS Flexbox, npm, and GitHub deployment, while having a little fun with my love for superheroes.

Check out the demo to learn how the Caped Crusaderâ€™s duds have evolved over the years.
