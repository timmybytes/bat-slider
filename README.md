# The Bat-Slider

![The Bat-Slider Screenshot](./src/img/bat-slider-screenshot.png)

This is a simple React app to display information on the various Bat-Suits seen in film over the years.

Bat-Slider uses [`rc-slider`](https://github.com/react-component/slider) and React Hooks to dynamically display content based on the many Batman suits seen in film since 1943.

## Why?

The goal of the project was to get more practice using state in React, JSON objects, CSS Flexbox, npm, and GitHub deployment, while having a little fun with my love for superheroes.

## Demo

Check out the demo to see how the Caped Crusaderâ€™s duds have evolved over the years.
